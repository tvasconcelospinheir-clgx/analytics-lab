# OneHome Persona Discovery
Last updated: 2026-05-03

**Goal:** Understand the most common flows of users and agents in OneHome using cluster-analysis-style behavioral grouping to identify personas and explain what each does in OneHome.

## ⚠️ Critical: Mixpanel Query Rules for This Project

The Mixpanel project (ID 2175557) contains events from 12+ apps (Matrix, OneHome, Realist, Agent Portal, etc.).

**Every query for this project MUST filter by `appId = OneHome`.**

- **API (JQL):** filter with `e.properties.appId === 'OneHome'`
- **Connector method:** always use `client.event_counts_by_app(app_id='OneHome', ...)` — never `event_counts_last_n_days()`, which has no appId filter and returns cross-app data.
- **UI (Mixpanel):** apply filter `appId = OneHome` AND `Basic Event Cleaner = True`.
- `Basic Event Cleaner` is a UI-only Data View filter — it cannot be applied in JQL. API counts will be slightly higher than UI counts (~0.2% gap confirmed in Phase 1).

**Forgetting this filter returns cross-app totals and completely wrong numbers.**

## Phase 0 — Manual Simulation ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal:** Discover events and properties from the ground up before touching any API.

**Findings:**
- `groupId` — likely the key property to distinguish agents from consumers. Update Phase 3 accordingly.
- `deviceType` — potentially interesting for platform split (may complement or replace `isMobileApp`).
- Anchor events confirmed: the ones in our custom bundles appear to be the right signal events.
- `authenticated` observed to flip from `false` → `true` after login — confirms it is an **event-level property** (session state), not a user property.
- Hypothesis: `registered` may be a **user/people property** (static, set once after signup) while `authenticated` is dynamic per session.

**Open question carried to Phase 2:** Confirm `registered` is a People property and what values it takes.

---

## Phase 1 — Validate API Access ✅ PASSED

**Goal:** Confirm API data matches what you see in Mixpanel UI.

**Result:** Top events matched in order, volumes within 0.2%. Phase 1 gate passed.

**Required filters:**
- API: `e.properties.appId === 'OneHome'` in JQL
- UI: `appId = OneHome` AND `Basic Event Cleaner = True`

**Top events confirmed (7-day, appId=OneHome):**

| # | Event | API count |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Property Details - Photo Viewer - Right Arrow Click | 37,299,437 |
| 2 | Property Details - Landed | 13,530,397 |
| 3 | Entry Link - Session Not Logged In | 7,679,107 |
| 4 | Rateplug - Rateplug Failure - API Error | 6,645,218 |
| 5 | Initial App Load | 5,841,042 |

---

## Phase 2 — Open Property Questions ✅ COMPLETED

| # | Question | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Does `registered` exist as a People property? What values? | ✅ Yes — user-level property. Values: `true` / `false`. Stable sign-up status, set once. |
| Q2 | Does `ViewMode` exist as an event property? Values? | ✅ Yes — values: `1` (1,825,544) · `3` (1,182,000) · `4` (231,657) · `2` (3,595) · `5` (1) |
| Q3a | Does `isMobileApp` exist? | ✅ Yes — `false`: 3,140,143 · `true`: 1,866. Very skewed; use `deviceType` as primary. |
| Q3b | Does `deviceType` exist? | ✅ Yes — `mobile`: 2,696,946 · `desktop`: 751,817 · `tablet`: 156,727 · `unknown`: 5. Use alongside `isMobileApp`. |
| Q4 | Any other interesting properties? | None surfaced beyond what was already known. |
| Q5 | Is `authenticated` stable per user or event-level? | ✅ Event-level property (flips per session). `registered` is the stable user-level property (sign-up status). |

**Key decisions from Phase 2:**
- Use `ViewMode` values: `1` = Matrix email, `3` = Agent-shared link, `4` = Consumer-shared link. OH-02 flows confirmed.
- Use `deviceType` as primary platform split (`mobile` / `desktop` / `tablet`). Keep `isMobileApp` as secondary cross-check.
- `registered` (People property, true/false) → use for user-level cohort segmentation.
- `authenticated` (event property, flips per session) → use for session-level Flow splits.
- OH-03 and OH-07 confirmed viable.

**Phase 2 gate: PASSED. Proceeding to Phase 3.**

## Phase 3 — Agent vs Consumer Differentiator Investigation ✅ COMPLETED (no differentiator found)

**Inputs:** Two user exports — `user-export-2175557-2026_05_04_04_01_24.csv` (441K rows) and `user-export-2175557-2026_05_04_04_25_20.csv` (406K rows, with email).

**What we investigated:**

| Signal | Finding | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `agentIDs` | JSON list of **MLS IDs of agents connected to this consumer** — confirmed via business logic | ❌ Identifies consumers-with-an-agent, NOT whether the visitor IS an agent |
| `groupId` | UUID(s), populated for 100% of ALL users | ❌ Not a differentiator |
| `AgentID` (singular) | Empty for every profile row | ❌ Lives only as an event super property, not in profiles |
| `agentIDs` × `distinct_id` cross-ref | `agentIDs` values are external MLS member IDs — zero overlap with Mixpanel UUIDs | ❌ Different ID systems entirely |
| Email domains | Both groups ~90%+ personal emails (Gmail/Yahoo/Hotmail) | ❌ No signal |
| `ViewMode` | 1 = Matrix Email entry, 3 = Agent-Shared Link, 4 = Consumer-Shared Link — **all can be consumers** | ❌ Describes entry context, not user type |

**Correct interpretation of `agentIDs`:**
- Users **with** `agentIDs` populated = consumers who have ≥1 assigned agent (51.5% of users)
- Users **without** `agentIDs` = unknown — could be agents using OneHome, unmatched consumers, or anonymous
- `agentIDs` values are external MLS member IDs (e.g. `"65919"`, `"C2013002397"`) — not Mixpanel user IDs

**Root cause:** The implementation audit explicitly flagged this as Priority 2 — `userType` / `portalType` was never added to the tracking plan. There is no user-level property that identifies whether a OneHome visitor is an agent or consumer. This is a known instrumentation gap.

**Decision:** No reliable agent vs consumer split exists in Mixpanel. Proceed to Phase 4 without it. Segment by behavior (the actual goal). Note `agentIDs` populated = confirmed consumer-with-agent as a partial signal where useful.

**Phase 3 gate: CLOSED — no differentiator found, proceeding anyway.**

---

## Phase 4 — Segmentation Strategy Decision 🔲 Next

**Input:** Answers from Phases 2 and 3.

**Context from Phase 3:** No user-level agent vs consumer split is available in Mixpanel. The implementation never added a `userType` property.

**Agreed segmentation approach:**
- **Primary behavioral split:** Segment by `agentIDs` populated (confirmed consumer-with-agent, 51.5%) vs not populated (unknown, 48.5%). Use as a partial lens, not a definitive agent flag.
- **Entry context:** `ViewMode` — 1 (Matrix Email), 3 (Agent-Shared Link), 4 (Consumer-Shared Link). Describes how a session started, not who the user is.
- **Session state:** `authenticated` (event-level property — was user logged in for that event?)
- **Platform:** `deviceType` (mobile / desktop / tablet) and `isMobileApp` (true/false)
- **Accept the gap:** We cannot cleanly separate agents from consumers. Persona clusters will be behavioral, not role-based. Role inference can be a post-hoc interpretation if clusters naturally split.

**Gate:** Approved implicitly — proceed to Phase 5 Flows.

---

## Phase 5 — Build Flows 🔲 Pending

**Segmentation strategy:** TBD after Phase 4.
- Likely primary split: `authenticated` (session-level) or `groupId`/`registered` (user-level)
- Likely secondary splits: `ViewMode` (entry context), `deviceType` or `isMobileApp` (platform)

## Phase 6 — Cluster Analysis 🔲 Pending

**Input:** Top Paths CSVs from Phase 5.

**What I do:** Parse all path sequences, compute edit-distance similarity, identify 3–7 natural clusters. For each cluster describe: typical entry event, which custom bundles appear, path depth, whether a High Intent event appears.

**Rule:** No persona names yet. Behavior descriptions only. You review and confirm before we name anything.

---

## Phase 7 — Validation 🔲 Pending

**Goal:** Test that clusters actually predict behavior on fresh data.

**Pass criteria:** Each cluster covers >2% of users AND has a meaningfully different conversion rate from the others.

---

## Phase 8 — Persona Synthesis 🔲 Pending

**What I do:** Write persona cards — one per cluster. Each card: behavior pattern, entry context, platform, path depth/breadth, conversion likelihood, recommended product intervention.

**Naming happens here, after behavior is confirmed.**

## Key Findings So Far

- `appId` is a super property stamped on all events. Value `"OneHome"` has ~114M events/7 days.
- Other apps in same project: Matrix (228M), undefined (162M), APPLICATION_NAME_MLS_TOUCH (57M), Realist (15M), Agent Portal (5.5M), and more.
- **No agent vs consumer differentiator exists** in Mixpanel. `userType` was never instrumented (known gap, audit Priority 2). `agentIDs` = list of agents connected to a consumer — NOT an agent-identity flag.
- `groupId` is 100% populated for all users — not a differentiator (hypothesis disproved in Phase 3).
- `agentIDs` populated (51.5% of users) = confirmed consumer-with-an-agent. Best partial signal available.
- `authenticated` is an event-level property (flips per session), not a user property.
- `registered` is a stable user-level property (sign-up status: true/false).
